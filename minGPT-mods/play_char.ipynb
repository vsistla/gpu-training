    "### * Memory management - Unlike many other languages, Python does not necessarily release the memory back to the Operating System. Instead, it has a dedicated object allocator for smaller objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### * You will notice that Python created folders with __pycache__ and also files with .pyc or .pyo extension. These are bytecode-compiled and optimized bytecode-compiled versions of your program's files, respectively. They make your program start a little faster. When your scripts change, they will be recompiled, and if you delete the files or the whole folder and run your program again, they will reappear (unless you specifically suppress that behavior). Just put them in your gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "### * Python garbage collection can also come in handy - but most of the time you don't need to use gc.collect but there some advantages in calling gs.collect at the end of your loop - you will reduce memory fragmentation. Trying to free the memory between computations using gc.collect() fixed the memory-related aspect of the problem but it could also result in performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### * Of course Multi threaded programming might work much better instead of having to do gc.collect after the end of every loop. Once the thread ends, the memory is automatically freed without the strange performance issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "### * a note about CPU time - Do be aware though that CPU percentage can jump around quite a lot from one moment to another and especially where the time period it is calculated over keeps changing. This can be quite confusing. Use a background thread which works out CPU percentage average over set time ranges.\n",
